important:

- [done] (ui) not fully responsive
- [done] need to be able to pop up alert messages if the contract rejects something
for some reason (system errors)
- [done] (bug) after approving the create page fails to load without refresh because
we didn't pass the target in
- [done] (bug) after approving someone, we should wait until the contract call finishes
until we progress forward, otherwise the page isn't fully filled out
and the user will have to refresh. maybe put in an event to wait for user to
have an agreement and then progress on to create.
- [done] (bug) error if we go to /swap and metamask isn't logged in
- [done] (bug) after cancelling I have to refresh because cancel doesn't wait on the transaction
to finish
- [done] (bug) after creation we need to clear local storage
- [done] (bug) addresses aren't being checked on approval button click
- [done] (bug) after depositing assets I wasn't sent to withdraw page
- [done] (bug) put something in
address bar then remove, we don't see invalid address alert, it lets us continue
- [done] (ui) add disclaimer about product being new and unaudited
- [done] [contract] fix tests
- [done] [contract] make sure users cannot approve themselves
- [done] [contract] make fees happen on swap approval
- [done] [contract] don't allow cancelling if nothing to cancel

unimportant (for now):
- change the verify on create so that it has a cancel button that is red instead of
making them use the X
- change address bar urls
- (ui) need to say 'Add NFTs' or something if there are none
- (bug) depositing all NFTs in quick succession causes us to go to the withdraw
page before they can each complete depositing (fixed by refresh)
- [contract] (weirdness) unmanaged assets is pretty worthless when it returns
address zero
